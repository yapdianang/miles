description: Launch recipe for Xiaomi's MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL (309B MoE, hybrid sliding-window attention) — Megatron bridge mode on a BF16 conversion, on two 8-GPU nodes.
---
## 1. Model Introduction

[MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL](https://huggingface.co/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL) is Xiaomi's 309B-parameter MoE model (15B active). miles trains its text decoder.

**Key highlights:**

- **Hybrid attention**: 39 sliding-window layers (window 128, learnable attention sink) and 9 global layers, with different KV head counts (8 vs 4) and RoPE bases (1e4 vs 1e7).
- **Asymmetric heads**: 192-dim Q/K and 128-dim V, V scaled by 0.707, partial RoPE (64 of 192 dims).
- **MoE**: 256 routed experts, top-8 sigmoid routing with a fixed score-correction bias; layer 0 is dense.
- **Compressed checkpoint**: FP8 block-quantized dense weights with a fused, kv-head-interleaved `qkv_proj`, and MXFP4 experts. The Megatron bridge reads a BF16 split-q/k/v conversion instead.

## 2. Supported Variants

| `--model-name` | What it is | HF source |
|---|---|---|
| `MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL-bf16` | text decoder, 48 layers | [XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL](https://huggingface.co/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL) |

The vision, audio and MTP modules stay in the checkpoint but are not trained (text-only RL).

## 3. Environment Setup

### 3.1 Download + BF16 conversion

`prepare` (run by the launcher before training) downloads the official checkpoint to `<model-dir>/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL` and converts it unless `<model-dir>/<model-name>` already holds a finished conversion:

```bash
hf download XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL --local-dir /root/models/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL
python tools/convert_mimo_v2_to_bf16.py --model-dir /root/models/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL \
    --save-dir /root/models/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL-bf16 --device cuda
```

The converter dequantizes each kv-head shard of the fused `qkv_proj` with its own FP8 block scales, splits it into q/k/v in head order, and decodes the MXFP4 experts. The BF16 model is 622 GB.

### 3.2 SGLang

The engine needs the MiMo-V2 fixes that are not in the image yet:

- upstream [sgl-project/sglang#40448](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/40448) (MXFP4 MoE and BF16 router);
- accepting the `split` attention layout of the BF16 conversion;
- allocating the sliding-window KV pools inside the memory-saver region, otherwise a colocated engine cannot release its KV cache;
- passing `layer_id` to the MoE top-k, otherwise `--use-rollout-routing-replay` crashes the CUDA-graph capture;
- for the MXFP4 engines (section 4.2), an in-place reload in the MXFP4 Marlin MoE method: its post-processing repacks the experts and renames their scales, so without it the first weight sync writes checkpoint-shaped tensors into the Marlin layout and fails;
- for `mxfp4_w4a16_linear` at an engine attention TP of 1 or 2, regrouping the BF16 fused `qkv_proj` of each rank into its q, k and v heads; the unmodified loader keeps the kv-head interleave of the checkpoint there and serves wrong attention (the launcher's TP4 is not affected).

## 4. Launch

### 4.1 Two nodes

Join the second node to a ray head on the first, then launch from the head:

```bash
MILES_SCRIPT_EXTERNAL_RAY=1 MASTER_ADDR=<head ip> python scripts/run_mimo_v2_6_flash.py \
    --mode rl --model-name MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL-bf16 --num-nodes 2 --train-offload-disk-dir /scratch/offload
```

On two 8×H200 nodes with node-local NVMe (4-drive RAID0), a step with 16 samples of up to 2048 response tokens took about 4 minutes of training, of which about 3 minutes is streaming the optimizer state (72 GB read and 144 GB written per GPU), plus 30 s of weight update. Peak GPU memory was 125 GB and peak host memory 1.05 TB per node.

`--mode sft --prompt-data <chat jsonl>` trains SFT instead. It reads a `messages` column; put a reasoning trace in `reasoning_content`, since the MiMo chat template renders `<think>{reasoning_content}</think>`.

### 4.2 MXFP4 rollout engines (H200)

`--sglang-precision mxfp4_w4a16_linear` or `mxfp4_w4a8_linear` serves an MXFP4 checkpoint instead of the BF16 conversion, while the trainer keeps BF16 weights:

```bash
MILES_SCRIPT_EXTERNAL_RAY=1 MASTER_ADDR=<head ip> python scripts/run_mimo_v2_6_flash.py \
    --mode rl --model-name MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL-bf16 --num-nodes 2 --train-offload-disk-dir /scratch/offload \
    --sglang-precision mxfp4_w4a16_linear
```

| `--sglang-precision` | engine checkpoint | routed experts | fused `qkv_proj`, dense MLP | weight check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mxfp4_w4a16_linear` | `MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL-w4a16` (`--keep-quant --bf16-linears`) | MXFP4, Marlin W4A16 | BF16 | bit-exact |
| `mxfp4_w4a8_linear` | the official download | MXFP4, Marlin W4A16 | FP8 W8A8 (per-token-group activation quantization) | within the FP8 quantization error |

- `--hf-checkpoint` is the engine checkpoint above (`prepare` builds the `mxfp4_w4a16_linear` checkpoint from the download; the `mxfp4_w4a8_linear` engine serves the download itself), and `--ref-load` the BF16 conversion the trainer loads.
- Each weight sync re-encodes the engine format: MXFP4 experts, the modules in `ignored_layers` (`o_proj`, plus the qkv and dense MLP for `mxfp4_w4a16_linear`) as BF16, and the remaining FP8 linears as FP8 blocks (per kv-head shard of the fused `qkv_proj`).
- The engine runs with TP4: the fused `qkv_proj` splits into 4 kv-head shards, so the engine's attention TP must divide 4.
- MXFP4 experts come back bit-exact from the BF16 weights. FP8 block scales come back only within the quantization error (the block maximum is BF16-rounded), so `mxfp4_w4a8_linear` adds `--check-weight-update-allow-quant-error`.
- `mxfp4_w4a8_linear` quantizes the activations of the fused `qkv_proj` and the dense MLP to FP8, which roughly doubles the BF16 engine's train/rollout log-prob gap; `mxfp4_w4a16_linear` keeps those linears in BF16 and stays within the BF16 engine's range, at about 3 GB more weights. The MXFP4 experts add no measurable gap.
- The MTP layers keep their source format in both checkpoints: Miles does not train them, and SGLang's draft model maps their names differently.
- The sync quantizer picks each block's E8M0 scale with the EVEN rule (the block maximum rounded to one mantissa bit, then `floor(log2) - 2`), so a block maximum drifting off a grid value keeps its scale; the official experts still re-encode byte-identically.
- `--mxfp4-qat-routed-experts` (pass it through `--extra-args`; needs `--stream-optimizer-state-to-disk`) projects the routed experts onto the MXFP4 grid after every optimizer step, so the trainer computes with the experts the engine serves while the fp32 master keeps the full update. Without it an update smaller than one MXFP4 step does not reach the engine, and the train/rollout mismatch grows with the expert updates. With both, a 50-step run with `mxfp4_w4a16_linear` on two H200 nodes kept the train/rollout KL at 0.88–1.10× the BF16 engine's per 10-step window.
- On B300 (`--hardware B300`) the launcher selects Marlin for `mxfp4_w4a16_linear` and DeepGEMM for `mxfp4_w4a8_linear`, with FA4 attention; the SGLang support they need on SM100 (Marlin admitting SM100, an in-place weight reload for the DeepGEMM runner) is not yet part of the requirements in section 3.2.
- HF export (`--save-hf`) builds its bridge from `--hf-checkpoint`, so with an MXFP4 engine it writes that checkpoint's config over BF16 tensors; export from a BF16-engine run instead.

## 5. Recipe Configuration

### 5.1 Parallelism

| `--model-name` | TP | PP | CP | EP | expert-TP | GPUs | rollout engine |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MiMo-V2.6-Flash-RL-bf16` | 2 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 1 | 16 (2 × 8) | one engine per node: attention TP4 × DP2 (`--sglang-enable-dp-attention --sglang-dp-size 2 --sglang-enable-dp-lm-head`), EP8, `--sglang-mem-fraction-static 0.72` |

TP is capped at 4 by the four global-attention KV heads. Context parallelism is not supported. `--sequence-parallel` is on whenever TP > 1. THD packing with `--use-dynamic-batch-size` is the default; `--qkv-format bshd` runs one sample per micro-batch. `--max-tokens-per-gpu` defaults to 16384 on H200 and to 9216 on B300; at 16384 a 50-step run peaked at 98.5% of GPU memory (PP stage 1).

### 5.2 Algorithm

GRPO with `--eps-clip 0.2 --eps-clip-high 0.28 --entropy-coef 0.00` and `--rm-type math` on dapo-math-17k. `--n-samples-per-prompt` (default 8) and `--rollout-max-response-len` (default 8192) set the group size and the response cap. No KL loss: bridge mode has no Megatron reference model (with an MXFP4 engine, `--ref-load` only names the trainer's BF16 weights).

### 5.3 Optimizer

Adam at `--lr 1e-6`. The model's Adam state (3.7 TB) fits neither the GPUs nor two hosts' memory, so it streams through node-local NVMe:

```bash
--stream-optimizer-state-to-disk
--stream-optimizer-state-moment-dtype bf16
--grad-reduce-in-bf16
--offload-train-target disk
--offload-train-disk-dir <train-offload-disk-dir>
```

### 5.4 Notable quirks

- **Fused attention only**: `--attention-backend fused`. The learnable sink on the sliding-window layers is implemented by TE's FusedAttention (THD needs cuDNN ≥ 9.18) and the unfused path, not by FlashAttention.
- **Sliding window**: a SWA layer attends the query plus `sliding_window_size` (128) previous keys, 129 in total, as SGLang does; the bridge sets `window_size = (sliding_window_size, 0)`. The HF modeling code and Megatron-Bridge's `mimo_v2_flash` attend 128 keys in total (`sliding_window_size - 1` previous), so a log-prob comparison against them differs at positions past the window.
- **Dropout**: the bridge sets `hidden_dropout = 0`. Bridge mode does not copy `--hidden-dropout` onto the provider, so a provider left at Megatron's default (0.1) trains with dropout silently.
- **Frozen towers and `--check-weight-update-equal`**: the trainer never sends the vision/audio weights, so exclude them from the post-update check with `--check-weight-update-skip-list visual. audio_tokenizer. input_local_transformer. speech_embeddings. projection.mlp.`.
