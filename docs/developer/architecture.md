A reading guide before you start patching.

## The processes

A Miles run is three kinds of processes wrapped in a Ray cluster:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Ray cluster
        subgraph "Trainer (1+ Megatron group)"
            T1[Actor rank 0]
            T2[Actor rank 1]
            T3[Actor rank ...]
        end
        subgraph "Rollout (N SGLang servers + Miles Router)"
            R1[SGLang server 1]
            R2[SGLang server 2]
            MR[Miles Router]
            R1 -. health, route .- MR
            R2 -. health, route .- MR
        end
        D[Data Source<br/>RolloutDataSourceWithBuffer]
        T1 <-- weight sync --> R1
        T1 <-- weight sync --> R2
        D --> MR
        MR --> D
    end
```

* **Trainer ranks** — Megatron processes that load `torch_dist` checkpoints and run the
  RL loop.
* **SGLang servers** — independent HTTP services that produce rollouts.
* **Miles Router** — FastAPI proxy that distributes rollout requests, preserves
  metadata (R3), and enforces health checks.
* **Data Source** — Python object owned by the trainer; reads prompt JSONL and acts as
  a buffer between rollout and training.

## The package layout

└── utils/                # arguments.py, async / IO / distributed helpers, audit_utils/
```

The `miles_plugins/` tree sits beside it. Nothing in `miles/` imports it directly: a plugin
is loaded only when a run names its import path in a flag (`--spec`, or one of the
`--custom-*-path` flags). `models/` holds Megatron specs and HF module wrappers, `mbridge/`
per-architecture weight bridges, `megatron_bridge/` the `megatron.bridge` shims, and
`optimizers/` optimizer plugins.

`train.py`, `train_async.py` and `train_multi_lora_async.py` are the entry points. They are
thin; most logic lives in the modules above.

## A request's life

For a single GRPO iteration:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Trainer
    participant DS as DataSource
    participant MR as MilesRouter
    participant SG as SGLang
    participant RM as RewardFn

    T->>DS: get_samples(N)
    DS-->>T: prompts
    T->>MR: generate(prompts)
    MR->>SG: dispatch
    SG-->>MR: responses + meta_info
    MR-->>T: samples
    T->>RM: score(samples)
    RM-->>T: rewards
    T->>T: GRPO loss / step
    T->>SG: weight_sync(p2p)
```

This is the sync path. Fully async (`train_async.py --fully-async`) breaks the request
from the trainer loop and uses a continuously-running worker.

## Where common changes go

| You want to … | Edit |
|---|---|
| Add a new RL algorithm | `miles/backends/training_utils/loss.py` and `loss_hub/`, plus the enum in `miles/utils/arguments.py` |
| Add a new built-in reward type | `miles/rollout/sglang_rollout.py` (rm dispatch) |
| Add a new built-in filter | `miles/rollout/filter_hub/` |
| Support a new architecture on Megatron | `miles_plugins/models/<model>.py` + a bridge in `miles_plugins/mbridge/` |
| Support a new architecture on FSDP | `miles/backends/fsdp_utils/adaptations/specs/<arch>.py` |
| Add a new flag | `miles/utils/arguments.py` |
| Change weight sync | `miles/backends/megatron_utils/update_weight/` (Megatron) or `miles/backends/fsdp_utils/update_weight_utils.py` (FSDP) |
| Change rollout buffer | `miles/rollout/data_source.py` |

## Extension points (the right way)

The trainer is plug-in-friendly. Most extensions don't need a code change inside Miles —
just pass a `--something-path my_pkg.thing`. See [Customization](/user-guide/customization)
for the full list.

If you find yourself patching the trainer to make something work, that's a sign we're
missing a hook. Open an issue.

## Tests

```text
tests/
├── fast/             # CPU CI only — each test_*.py auto-registers as stage-a-cpu (register_cuda_ci is rejected here)
├── fast-gpu/         # GPU or CPU CI, registered explicitly (register_cuda_ci / register_cpu_ci)
├── ci/               # the suite runner + registry, with their own CPU CI
├── e2e/              # end-to-end (spins up Ray + SGLang); GPU or CPU CI, registered explicitly
├── manual/           # run on request, not discovered by the CI runner
└── snapshots/        # recorded fixtures the launch-script and other snapshot tests assert against
```

CI discovery is location-based. The `tests/fast/` folder may hold **only CPU CI**: every `test_*.py`
there auto-registers as `stage-a-cpu`, so no boilerplate is needed — write a literal `register_cpu_ci(...)`
only to override the defaults, and a `register_cuda_ci` under `tests/fast/` is an error (move the file
to `tests/fast-gpu/`). Every other folder may hold **GPU or CPU CI** and must register each test
explicitly with `register_cpu_ci` / `register_cuda_ci`. The runner collects `tests/fast/`,
`tests/fast-gpu/`, `tests/e2e/`, and `tests/ci/`.

Run `pytest tests/fast` for a quick CPU check (`pytest tests/fast-gpu` if you have a GPU);
run `tests/e2e` before landing anything that touches the train loop.

## Where to look first when reading the code

If you have 30 minutes and want to understand Miles end-to-end:

1. `train.py` — the loop, top-to-bottom.
2. `miles/rollout/sglang_rollout.py:generate_rollout` — how prompts become samples.
3. `miles/backends/training_utils/loss.py` — the loss and advantage computation.
4. `miles/router/router.py` — the FastAPI proxy.
5. `miles/backends/megatron_utils/update_weight/` — how trained weights reach the engines.

That's the spine. Everything else hangs off it.
