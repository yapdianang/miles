## About

Miles is a high-performance, enterprise-ready reinforcement learning framework for
**large-scale model post-training**. It pairs [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)
for high-throughput rollout with [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) for
scalable training, and ships the precision, stability and observability features an RL run
needs at trillion-parameter scale. A PyTorch FSDP2 backend is available for runs that would
rather train the HuggingFace implementation as-is, though the recipes, the parallelism and
the largest models all live on Megatron-LM. See
[Training Backends](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/user-guide/training-backend).

> *"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single rollout."*

### Performance

- **Fully async RL.** Rollout and training workers are decoupled, with configurable on- and
  off-policy schedules, a pipeline tuned for fewer bubbles, and customizable async rollout
  and eval modes. See [Fully Async RL](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/user-guide/fully-async).
- **Fast agentic rollout.** Generation runs on [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)
  behind a router that spreads requests across engines, preserves per-request metadata and
  health-checks the fleet. Tuned for multi-turn agentic workloads.
- **Fast weight updates.** New weights reach the engines in-loop in seconds, even on a
  trillion-parameter model such as Kimi-K2.6, with
  [P2P RDMA](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/p2p-weight-transfer) as the fast path
  for disaggregated setups.
- **Low-precision training.** [MXFP8 and NVFP4](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/low-precision)
  training with a numerically stable RL recipe that reduces precision-induced divergence.
  FP8, [INT4 QAT](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/int4-qat), BF16 and FP16 are also
  supported.
- **LoRA and multi-LoRA.** [Low-rank adapters](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/lora)
  train frontier-scale models on a fraction of the GPUs, and the same adapters load straight
  into SGLang for rollout.

### Correctness and resilience

- **Token-in-token-out (TITO).** Supported for
  [every model and every black-box harness](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/user-guide/agentic-rollout),
  with no detokenize and retokenize round-trip between rollout and training.
- **Rollout Routing Replay (R3).** Expert routing recorded during rollout is
  [replayed in the trainer's forward pass](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/miles-router),
  removing the MoE routing mismatch that destabilizes large runs, with compute and
  communication overlapped to keep the cost down.
- **Fault tolerance.** When an SGLang engine dies, Miles
  [recovers it and resumes the run in place](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/fault-tolerance):
  no restart, no pause.
- **Miles dashboard.** A self-hosted web UI for a run's
  [training dynamics and compute efficiency](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/user-guide/dashboard):
  what every GPU was doing during a step, and what each trajectory contained at the token
  level.

### What Miles runs

- **Day-0 model support.** DeepSeek-V4, Kimi-K3, GLM-5.2, Inkling and Nemotron landed on
  release day. Beyond day 0, nearly every frontier model runs on Miles, including Kimi-K2.6
  and Qwen3.5. See [Models](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/models).
- **Extensive hardware support.** NVIDIA GB300, GB200, B300, B200, H200, H100 and A100, and
  AMD MI300X, MI325, MI350 and MI355X via ROCm. See
  [Installation](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/getting-started/installation#hardware-requirements)
  for per-GPU status and the container image for each.
- **Wide recipe support.** GRPO, GSPO, PPO and REINFORCE++ for RL, plus SFT and
  [on-policy distillation](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/advanced/on-policy-distillation).
- **Agentic environments.** Train coding and computer-use agents through connectors for
  Harbor, HUD, NeMo Gym, OpenEnv, Verifiers and more, each plugging into the rollout
  layer that fits it, with task sandboxes on AgentENV, Daytona, E2B or Modal. See
  [Agentic Environments](https://miles.radixark.com/docs/user-guide/environments).
