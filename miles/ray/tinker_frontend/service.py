"""The tinker frontend service: official SDK verbs -> backend operations.

Request -> ordinal mapping (the D5 note in operations.py): the supported SDKs
holds one per-model counter — every training verb (each forward_backward
chunk, forward chunk, optim_step, save/load, sampler publish) consumes one
``seq_id``, consecutive from 1 — which is exactly the backend ledger's
per-registration ordinal contract. The frontend therefore forwards
``ordinal = seq_id`` verbatim; chunks the SDK posts out of order (first
chunk last, by design) arrive out of order and the ledger gap-buffers them.
A submission this layer rejects still consumes its ordinal as a terminal
FAILED(user) ledger record, so one bad chunk can never leave a gap that
starves the registration.

Future protocol: every heavy verb returns ``{"request_id"}`` and the SDK
polls /api/v1/retrieve_future. Request ids are deterministic in the SDK's
own coordinates ((session, model_seq_id) / (model, seq_id)), so a resent
submission lands on its original record: identical -> replay, different ->
422 (the SDK treats 409 as retryable, so a real conflict must never be 409).
Terminal bodies are stored for replay BEFORE the backend record is acked —
a response lost on the wire is re-polled and must find the same bytes.

This layer is deliberately thin: datum/loss validation and translation live
in translation.py, execution semantics live behind the controller surface
(register/deregister/enqueue/reject/get/ack + registry state), and sampling
proxies to the sglang router under the registration-scoped serving name.

Sampling is additionally guarded by a context preflight (prompt + max_tokens
against the engine context limit — configured or discovered, typed 400
before identity consumption) and observed through SamplingAdmission/
SamplingStats counters; a background maintenance loop reaps orphaned
sessions and futures without ever freeing an identity (code-0815 §6/§7).
