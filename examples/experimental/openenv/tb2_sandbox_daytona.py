"""Daytona materialization of the per-task Terminal-Bench-2 sandbox recipe.

The recipe itself — the shell layers that turn a task's official image into a
combined task+env-server image — lives in ``tb2_sandbox_recipe`` (sibling module)
and is provider-agnostic. This module is everything Daytona-specific about
turning that recipe into a running cloud sandbox:

  ``create_task_sandbox(...)``  per-episode declarative create straight from
      the ``Image`` definition. Named snapshots count against an org-level
      quota, so registering one per task may not scale to a full task suite;
      the declarative path avoids the quota entirely, and repeat creates hit
      Daytona's build cache (~1min after the first build). Daytona does not
      run the image CMD, so this execs ``server_cmd()`` and waits for /health.
      Sandboxes carry ownership labels (task / launcher / run id) and an
      auto-stop+auto-delete TTL armed as a dead-man's switch: a keepalive
      thread beats the activity timer while the creating process lives, so
      a hard-killed caller's orphans are reclaimed instead of billing forever.

There is deliberately no bake step here: on this provider the image definition
IS the cache key, so a create either hits the build cache or warms it, and
nothing a create passes can name a pre-registered snapshot — registering one
per task would only spend the org quota the declarative path exists to avoid.
