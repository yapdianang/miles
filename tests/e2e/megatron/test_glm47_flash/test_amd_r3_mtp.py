"""AMD 4-GPU variant of test_r3_mtp.py.

Standalone rather than an IS_HIP branch in the original: the MI300X fleet is
split into two 4-GPU runners, so the 8-GPU CUDA case cannot run there as
written, and keeping the variant separate means neither side's parallelism
constrains the other.

Difference from the CUDA case: cp_size 2 -> 1 and ep_size 4 -> 2, halving the
world size from 8 to 4. TP=2 and PP=2 are unchanged, so the MTP layer placement
under test is unaffected. Both axes have to shrink because Megatron sizes the
dense and expert grids independently -- world_size % (tp * cp * pp) == 0 and
world_size % (etp * ep * pp) == 0 -- so dropping CP alone leaves the expert grid
needing 8 ranks on a 4-rank world. CP and EP are the safe axes here: CP exists
for long-context throughput and EP for expert capacity, neither of which the
R3 + MTP behaviour under test depends on.
